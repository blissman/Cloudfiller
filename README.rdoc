== Cloudfiller

Problem:
We live in an age where we can Google almost anything. But sometimes there are

But what if there's nobody in our social circle who can answer the question?

Solution:
That's where Cloudfiller comes in: bridging gaps and connecting communities.

To Do:
* Devise/Sorcery for password handling
* Facebook API integration
* Bourbon Neat/Bitters
